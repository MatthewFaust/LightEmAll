This code implements "LightEmAll," a grid-based puzzle game where the goal is to connect all game pieces to a central power station by rotating pieces to align their connections. Key classes include `GamePiece`, which represents individual pieces with attributes like position and connection states, and `LightEmAll`, which manages the game logic, including board setup, edge creation, and game state updates. The `Edge` class represents connections between pieces with associated weights. The game involves initializing a grid-based puzzle, handling user input, updating game states, and rendering the game world.
